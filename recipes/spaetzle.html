            In a large bowl mix flour and a tablespoon of nutmeg until homogenous. Dig a hole in the center of the flour and drop some eggs in.
        Whisk the eggs in the hole and mix with the dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly so the gluten develops, the dough should have a smooth
        consistency. Let the dough rest in the refridgerator for 10 minutes and stir vigorously before boiling.

            In a pot, bring water to a boil. Pour the dough into the spaetzle press and press the dough into the water in a circular motion.
        let the noodles cook until they rise in the water and retain their shape when removed from the pot. Remove the noodles from the 
        pot with a wire scoop and move it to a strainer. Rinse the cooked noodles under cold water.
